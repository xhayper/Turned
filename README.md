# ChangedForge
Current stuff that needs to be worked on:

Fix code structure

Finish porting and removing unused imports/implementations and replace with the new ones

Rewriting the transfur code that Block was working on

Include the networking code Sasha was working on



# Other developers, please edit this as we work on the project and keep track of what is done

I will try to fix my code, however if I appear to be busy or you know of a working fix, then you are welcome to apply it

I will try to remain active
(Remove/edit this after all developers are added to this)
